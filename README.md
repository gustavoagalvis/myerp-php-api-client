## Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to this project.

### Finding something to do

Ask, or pick an issue and comment on it announcing your desire to work on it. Ideally wait until we assign it to you to minimize work duplication.

### Reporting an issue

- Search existing issues before raising a new one.

- Include as much detail as possible. In particular, we need to know which OS you're using.

### Pull requests

- Make it clear in the issue tracker what you are working on, so that someone else doesn't duplicate the work.

- Use a feature branch, not master.

- Rebase your feature branch onto origin/master before raising the PR.

- Keep up to date with changes in master so your PR is easy to merge.

- Be descriptive in your PR message: what is it for, why is it needed, etc.

- Make sure the tests pass

- Squash related commits as much as possible.

### Coding style

- Try to match the existing indent style.

- Don't abuse the pre-processor.

- Don't mix platform-specific stuff into the main code.
